    <p> In conclusion we should Eat less Meat to help save the Ecosystem, We should still highly respect farmers 
        whether their farm is big or small or has workers or not or animals or not as long as they treat their animals kindly. farmers
        and their workers work very hard to provide food for us and we should respect that. but when
        giant corporations with too much political power treat animals like mere objects without caring how miserable the animals are
        that is when it is considered a Factory Farm, These rich megacorporations maximize profit and minimize animal welfare. Family Owned
        Farms are very different from the modern day Meat Industry even if the facilities look similar. 
        My Family used to have a Farm and Barn with Animals but lost it during 
        World War 2 while the Factory Farms Remained.

    <p>My hobbies and interests are social justice activism, making videos and playing video games. In my Social Justice activism
        I was shocked to learn that there are thousands of horrible people who support the oppressor and never the victim,
        I was appauled by this, Every time a cop killed a black guy these people would always support
        the cop and not the victim, these people were horrible, I always supported the victim and also 
        encourage heroism and self-defense. I make videos on my YouTube channel but the censorship on YouTube is equivilant to
        that of a Totalitarian Dictatorship and i hope to one day make my own video sharing platform that supports 
        freedom of expression but also has no political bias like Rumble does, Not really
        Free Speech if it is so one sided is it. The video games i like to play are games which are included in Super Smash Bros And
        hope to make games about being a true hero, focused more on saving lives in game instead of killing.
